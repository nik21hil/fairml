**Bias Detection and Mitigation Toolkit for Responsible AI**

---

## 📝 **Overview**

`fairml` is a Python package designed to help data scientists and machine learning engineers **detect, visualize, and mitigate bias** in datasets and models seamlessly.

With intuitive APIs, rich visualizations, and practical mitigation techniques, `fairml` makes fairness-aware AI development accessible to every practitioner.

---

## ⚡ **Key Features**

✅ Bias detection metrics  
✅ Bias visualization dashboards  
✅ Pre-processing and post-processing mitigation methods  
✅ scikit-learn compatible pipelines  
✅ Lightweight, modular, and extensible design

---

## 💻 **Installation**

```
pip install fairml
```

*(Currently under development; install via GitHub for now)*

```
pip install git+https://github.com/nik21hil/fairml.git
```

---

## 🚀 **Quickstart**

```
from fairml import detection

# Example: Calculate Statistical Parity Difference
spd = detection.statistical_parity_difference(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features)
print("Statistical Parity Difference:", spd)
```

More detailed examples and notebooks are available in the `examples/` folder.

---

## 📊 **Modules**

- `detection.py`: Bias detection metrics  
- `visualization.py`: Fairness visualizations and plots  
- `mitigation.py`: Bias mitigation algorithms  
- `utils.py`: Helper functions
